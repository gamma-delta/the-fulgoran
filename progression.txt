Progression
- Crash with some life-support machines broken (CO2 scrubber)
- This puts you on a quick clock. Fix it!

---

You will always need:
- Food
- Water
- Oxygen
And shortly afterwards:
- Power
- Lightning protection
- Travel

Survival Needs
--------------

T0:
- Food: Gravewort
- Water: Ice melting
- Air: CO2 scrubber

T1:
- Farm plots w/ spoilage
- Sludge filtering
- Just cope with oxygen (this is your hunger clock)

Farm plots "burn" organic material to grow. Food spoils into organic materials.
- Potatoes make good food but poor spoilage
- Alfalfa gets processed into fiber and spoilage, but is inedible
- Gravewort grows fast but is unsustainable. It's your "microbe musher."
- You can make more plots in plots using Fulgoran dust, but it's very slow

Sludge filtering requires (of course) a filter.
It filters into water, stone, and Fulgoran dust.
Filters are made with stone and scrubgrass.

With one CO2 scrubber, your oxygen needs are *almost* completely offset.
I need to tune this so you are still losing oxygen, but very slowly.
